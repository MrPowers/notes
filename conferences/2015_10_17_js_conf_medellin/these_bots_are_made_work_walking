These bots are made for walking

It wasn't that fun to do bots with C

Walking is very hard.

The video of the darpa robots falling down in much easier.

It's really hard to make robots walk.

Rick Waldron is the inventor of Johnny Five

Johnny Five is a JavaScript robotics library with Node: https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five

Ronald Jaramillo created a GUI for doing animations with Johnny Five.  This app is called go-johnny-go.  It's an Express application.

We want to give values in x, y, z coordinates, we don't want to think about each coordinate individually.

I can't believe that people are doing so much with Robotic & JS.

JS is a quirky little language that is showing up in a bunch of different applications.

Intel Edison is an internet of things type of device.

Electric Imp is a cool little device.

There are a lot of people using JavaScript - that's the best part of JS.

JerryScript is a JS engine to run JS on microcontrollers (devices that don't have the RAM to run V8).  There is a really good chance that these microcontrollers will use JS.

Time that we spend working on hardware is time well spent.

johnny-five is really cool... I really need to check it out.

Nodebots has a great community.

johnny-five is a supportive GitHub community.
