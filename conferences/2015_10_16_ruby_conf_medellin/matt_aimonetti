Matt Aimonetti

He is from France.  He gave one of the speeches yesterday.

He started programming in Ruby professionally in 2005.

10 years ago, he was just writing code to build stuff... programming was a means to an end.  He wasn't really proud of his code.

The Pragmatic Programmer helps you understand programming in a different way.

Matz created Ruby to make programmers happy, not computers.

He watched the DHH Rails video

He shared a lot of the same values that were shared by the Rails community

"IRC is like Slack, but ugly, free and distributed"

Rubinius, JRuby, and MacRuby were all different implementations of Ruby

Big thank you to the open source community.

Matt is leaving the Ruby community.

Any programming language will die.  The question is when it will die.  When it will die depends on the community.

Value and encourage people that are trying to improve things.

Put this speech on Reddit.
