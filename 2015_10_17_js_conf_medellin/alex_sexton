Samy computer worm - it was a JS worm

You can't detect the scripts that are malicious and the scripts that are benign.

You can prevent script tags, but there are other ways that people can inject JavaScript.

Even if we disable JS, there are CSS hacks.

History knocking is an old-school CSS hack.

jsonp is very insecure - it lets people run arbitrary scripts on your page

We need a different approach.  There are a million ways to get hacked.  We can't address them all individually.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - it's a header where you can define different rules for the different stuff on your page.

A white list is key.  Block everyone and only allow the sites that you want to allow.

CSP is awesome is a great website to help you make a CSP.

ember-cli-content-security-policy is included by default in Ember.

Do HTTPS only - move people to https.  I need to do this on my site.
