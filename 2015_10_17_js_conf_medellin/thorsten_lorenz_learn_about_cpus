Thorsten Lorenz

He works on Node

Assembly gets you as close to the metal as you can without writing 0s and 1s

assembly is very close to the CPU

The CPU doesn't understand JS, C, or assembly... it only understands 0s and 1s

If you learn assembly, you can understand what the CPU does step-by-step

If you minify code without a source map, you can't convert it back to the original.

Node.js is really low in the stack.

He went from .net -> Node -> C -> assembly

Read the book Assembly Language Step by Step

The CPU doesn't have memory, it only has registers

Opcodes are what the CPU understands.  This is what is consumed by the CPU.
