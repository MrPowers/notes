"I suck at communication"

She has a really bad stutter.

Sometimes she stutters when she says her name.

As a result of her stutter, she had to learn to communicate with people in a meaningful way.

She is a marketer.

Stuttering runs in her family.  Most people outgrow their stutter.

Her parents assumed that she would outgrow her stutter.

She started chaging words in her head so she wouldn't stutter.  She knew someone that read the dictionary to avoid stuttering.  She eventually got to the point where she just decided to not talk that much.

When you stop speaking, you give the impression that you're not interested in the other person you're talking too.

It's hard for people that stutter to be with other people that stutter.

She took therapy with another person that stuttered... it was hard for her.

It looks like speakers for conferences are usually paid.
